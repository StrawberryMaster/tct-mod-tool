# [The Campaign Trail Mod Tool](https://strawberrymaster.github.io/tct-mod-tool/)

For context, this is a fork of [Jet's The Campaign Trail Mod Tool](https://jetsimon.com/Jets-The-Campaign-Trail-Mod-Tool-Website/). The main difference here is that it implements several of [madbailey](https://github.com/madbailey)'s changes on their fork of the aforementioned tool, including the revamped layout for editing questions and state scores. Some other advancements include:
* Upgraded to Vue 3, which brings improved performance
    * Especially when working with large mods!
* Reactive elements for a smoother user experience - no more switching between states to see changes
* A smarter-ish autosave system that reduces data loss
* Modernizations for better code organization and maintainability
* A couple of revamped sections, such as the CYOA and State tabs, for consistency (and following madbailey's lead)
* Other accessibility improvements

This is a graphical mod creation tool for [The Campaign Trail](https://www.americanhistoryusa.com/campaign-trail/).

Currently it supports importing code 2 files and then exporting them to share with others. If you do not have a code 2 to base off of, you can find them in the modding community or use [one I have here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetSimon/Jets-The-Campaign-Trail-Mod-Tool/main/src/default_code2.js) as a default.

**Features**

* You (should) be able to import any existing code 2 and keep working off of it. If yours doesn't work please let me know so I can make it work! I've tested on ~10 and they work.
* Complete GUI interface - no coding strictly required
* Ability to add and delete answers and provides a centralized place to modify answer effects and feedback without flipping around files
* Change state margins
* Change issue effects
* Generates new PKs automatically
* Export and share
* Has the ability to make CYOA mods! (Cannot import existing CYOA data from mods made outside of this program).

**What this modding tool CANNOT do (yet):**

* Code 1 creation (though this part is generally seen as the “easier” part of modding, so I think you guys got this!)
* Does not support custom endings, or any other non-listed mods that involve custom JavaScript
* Does not add any aesthetic changes to the end of code 2. You’ll have to add those manually after export.

If you have any issues report them on the GitHub in the issues tab.

Happy mod making,

Jet
